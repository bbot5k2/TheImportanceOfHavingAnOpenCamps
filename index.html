        <p>
            The importance of having an open campus is based on the idea that allowing students more freedom 
            can improve their overall school experience. Having an open campus can increase student satisfaction 
            with school. Surveys often ask students about their happiness, stress levels, and overall school 
            experience, and schools with open campuses report higher student satisfaction scores compared to 
            closed-campus schools. In a 2021 survey of high school students in California, 78% of students with 
            open campuses reported feeling more independent and satisfied with their school experience.

        <p>
            This PSA uses real student survey data and comparisons between open and closed campuses (ethos). 
            Open campuses can also reduce stress and increase student happiness (pathos). Evidence clearly 
            shows that schools with open campuses consistently have higher student satisfaction (logos). 
            Schools should have open campuses for students during lunch hours.
